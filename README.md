# MCP-IQWiki: Model Context Protocol Server for IQ.wiki

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to interact with IQ.wiki data. It allows MCP-compatible clients (like AI assistants, IDE extensions, or custom applications) to access wiki information such as specific wikis by ID, user-created wikis, user-edited wikis, and detailed wiki activities.

## Features (MCP Tools)

The server exposes the following tools that MCP clients can utilize:

- **`GET_WIKI`**: Get details about a specific wiki from the IQ.wiki platform.

  - Parameters: `id` (string) - The ID of the wiki to retrieve.

- **`GET_USER_CREATED_WIKIS`**: List wikis created by a specific user on IQ.wiki.

  - Parameters: `id` (string) - The Ethereum address of the user.
  - Parameters: `timeFrameSeconds` (number, optional) - Time frame in seconds to filter results.

- **`GET_USER_EDITED_WIKIS`**: List wikis edited by a specific user on IQ.wiki.

  - Parameters: `id` (string) - The Ethereum address of the user.
  - Parameters: `timeFrameSeconds` (number, optional) - Time frame in seconds to filter results.

- **`GET_USER_WIKI_ACTIVITIES`**: Get detailed wiki activities (creations or edits) for a user on IQ.wiki.
  - Parameters: `id` (string) - The Ethereum address of the user.
  - Parameters: `activityType` (enum: "CREATED" | "UPDATED", optional) - Type of activity to filter by.
  - Parameters: `timeFrameSeconds` (number, optional) - Time frame in seconds to filter results.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or newer recommended)
- pnpm (See <https://pnpm.io/installation>)

## Installation

There are a few ways to use `mcp-iqwiki`:

**1. Using `pnpm dlx` (Recommended for most MCP client setups):**

You can run the server directly using `pnpm dlx` without needing a global installation. This is often the easiest way to integrate with MCP clients.

```bash
pnpm dlx @iqai/mcp-iqwiki
```

**2. Global Installation from npm (via pnpm):**

Install the package globally to make the `mcp-iqwiki` command available system-wide:

```bash
pnpm add -g @iqai/mcp-iqwiki
```

**3. Building from Source (for development or custom modifications):**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IQAIcom/mcp-iqwiki.git
    cd mcp-iqwiki
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Build the server:**
    This compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `dist` directory.

    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```

## Running the Server with an MCP Client

MCP clients (like AI assistants, IDE extensions, etc.) will run this server as a background process. You need to configure the client to tell it how to start your server.

Below is an example configuration snippet that an MCP client might use (e.g., in a `mcp_servers.json` or similar configuration file):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iq-wiki-mcp-server": {
      "command": "pnpm",
      "args": ["dlx", "@iqai/mcp-iqwiki"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative if Globally Installed:**

If you have installed `mcp-iqwiki` globally, you can simplify the command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iq-wiki-mcp-server": {
      "command": "mcp-iqwiki",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```
